// Variables

// Declare a variable called "father" and assign it the value of "Hugo"
// var, let, const
// constant - never changes

let dad = "Hugo";

// const dad ;

//print whatever is inside () to the console
console.log(dad);

// father = "Hugo";

// Checks the status of whatever is in the () and if its true, runs the {}
// If it is fales, runs whatever is in the else {}
//if the age is > 50, make fun of the person, otherwise, tease them
